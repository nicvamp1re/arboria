[space-location-description]
arboria=A moon of Gleba with no surface water or animal life. Underground water supplies and mineral rich soils caused this planet to have some resourse rich trees.

[entity-description]
red-baobab=A tree with no leaves and wood, that is very rich with copper and energy.
iron-willow=The leaves and small twigs of this tree are rich with iron and sulfur. Additionally, the trunk of this tree is practically made of stone.
resin-maple=Despite the name, does not grow any maple-like leaves. Instead it forms a blob of brewable resin, that is extremely useful in production.
